Sending Bulk Invites
====================

To add friends in bulk, create a file in your home directory called
"lantern-bulk-friends.txt" with a single email address on each line.

When you start Lantern, it will automatically look for that file and
invite all email addresses in that file.

User home directories are at the following locations:

**Windows Vista/7/8:** C:/Users/USERNAME/lantern-bulk-friends.txt

**Windows XP:** C:/Documents and
Settings/USERNAME/lantern-bulk-friends.txt

**Mac:** /Users/USERNAME/lantern-bulk-friends.txt

**Ubuntu:** /home/USERNAME/lantern-bulk-friends.txt
