Just a random assortment of questions we might want to answer with a
survey:

-  How important is it to Give mode users to control what can (or can't)
   be access by other Lantern users via their connection?
-  How important is it to Give mode users to control the amount of
   bandwidth given to Lantern?

(Maybe we want to ask how would these answers vary if they had the
option to proxy only their immediate friends?)
