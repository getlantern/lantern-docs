Lantern Network Building
========================

Lantern depends on a strong trust network of users that spans the
censorship divide and that includes enough Give mode users to have
proxies available when censored users need them.

To this end, both Give and Get mode users need tools to help them grow
their trust networks. The benefits of growing the Lantern trust network
aren't immediately palpable to users. It may take Give mode users a
while before they see any Get mode users connecting through their proxy.
Due to the immediate availability of fallback proxies, Get mode users
may not sense the importance of building their trust network in order to
improve the speed and reliability of the Lantern proxy network.

Given these challenges, Lantern should both make it as easy as possible
to grow one's trust network, as well as provide education,
encouragement, and engaging experiences to get users to do so.

The tools for growing ones network are applicable for both Give and Get
mode, while education and encouragement need to be sensitive to
differences in the Give and the Get mode experiences.

This document outlines approaches for addressing all of these aspects of
building the trust network.

note - It is important to remember that much network building can
proceed informally and outside of the Lantern application - ultimately
Lantern just needs to know once the connection has been made. Before
going too far down the road of building specific tooling, we should make
sure to talk with our "connectors", i.e. the people who have
relationships that bridge the censorship divide and who are likely to be
the lynchpins of the Lantern trust network in its early stages.

Finding and inviting friends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lantern should make it easy to find Lantern friends, in particular ones
who can help bridge the censorship divide. To this end, Lantern should
integrate with popular social networks

-  Email via Google contacts (already implemented)
-  Google+ circles
-  LinkedIn
-  Facebook
-  Twitter

Not all friends are created equally. We want to connect users from
uncensored countries with users in censored countries. To this end, we
want to prioritize relationships where:

1. The friends have different censorship status
2. One of the friends has connections to people with a different
   censorship status

Item 1 can be accomplished with most social APIs that include location
information about friends (which is most of them). The problem is that
there aren't necessarily a lot of people who have friends across the
censorship divide.

Item 2 can be accomplished with LinkedIn. The upside to this is that it
can help us expand the pool of "connectors".

What else do we need here? Many social networking invite systems have a
way of tracking replies, resending reminders and so on...

Education and Encouragement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many angles to this. It is instructive to look at what both
social networks and electronic appliances like the `Nest
thermostat <http://nest.com/>`__.

Social networks repeatedly encourage you to build out your network by:

-  Suggesting new friends based on existing friends and interests
-  Suggesting new friends based on contacts in your contact list
-  Providing a mechanism for friends to message each other
-  Reminding you about events in friends' lives (e.g. birthdays) to get
   you to reach out and communicate with that friend. In the case of
   Lantern, this could be something like "Sally got access through Joe
   for the first time ever" (see
   https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues/1048)

The Nest thermostat has some interesting parallels with Lantern because
it's also something with which you interact infrequently and that you
use to meet a very specific goal (saving energy while staying
comfortable). Two things that the Nest thermostat does particularly well
are:

1. It collects a variety of interesting metrics but distills these down
   into a single easy-to-understand number, namely how many hours your
   heating/cooling system ran in the last month. From there, one can
   drill down into the other metrics to understand what led to that
   usage, but having that single bottom-line number makes it easy to
   keep track of what's happening without having to invest too much
   mental bandwidth.

2. It uses monthly emails to let you know how you're doing, make you
   feel like part of a community and remind you that there's a team of
   people constantly making Nest better.

In the case of Lantern, Give and Get mode users have complementary but
slightly different goals.

Get mode users are interested in availability and speed. Give mode users
are interested in helping out as many people as possible (or specific
people), but also limiting how much of their bandwidth is consumed, and
what sites are being visited through their connections.

This suggests a hierarchy of metrics like the following (all broken down
on a monthly basis if possible):

-  Number of bytes proxied
-  Number of peers active at any time during month
-  Number of hours that Lantern was running (see
   https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues/1025)
-  Top 5 domains proxied by # of requests (see
   https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues/1027)
-  ???

The first two sub-metrics, # of peers and # of hours, present points for
clear calls to action when the numbers are low, namely "grow your
network" and "run lantern".

These are both things about which we can and should remind people via
email.

Email Schedule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Welcome to Lantern
2. (If user hasn't added any friends) - Add Some Friends
3. Monthly Status Update
4. ???
